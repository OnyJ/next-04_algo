# Algorithms projects

## What to do :

- Clone the repo

- In the first folder are sorting projects. To use it just run

  - `node sorting_functions.js list.txt` in the console to see Bubble and Insert sorting programs, working with `file.txt` numbers.
  - `node merge_sort.js numbers_merge1.txt numbers_merge2.txt` to see the Merge sort program in action. You can change numbers files for other tests.

- And more algorithms in the second folder to run the same way.

Enjoy

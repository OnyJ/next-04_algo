# Algorithms projects

## What to do :

- Clone the repo

- In the first folder are sorting projects. To use it just run 
  - `node sorting_functions.js list.txt` in the console to see Bubble and Insert sorting programs on the `file.txt` numbers.
  - `node merge_sort.js` to see the Merge sort program in action. Numbers are in this js file.

- And more algorithms in the second folder to run the same way.

Enjoy

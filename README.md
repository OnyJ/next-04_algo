# Algorithms projects

## What to do :

- Clone the repo

- In the first folder are sorting projects. To use it just run

  - `node sorting_functions.js list.txt` in the console to see Bubble and Insert sorting programs, working with `list.txt` and `list2.txt` numbers.
  - `node merge_sort.js` to see the Merge sort program in action (using `list.txt` and `list2.txt`). You can change numbers in files for other tests.

- The second projects algorithms are in `projet2_algos` folder. Proceed the same way to run tests with the `numbers.txt` file.

Enjoy
